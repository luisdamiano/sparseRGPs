# sparseRGPs
This R package contains code to fit sparse and full Gaussian processes (GPs) on
Gaussian, binary, or Poisson data.

To download this package you can either clone it to your machine or run
```devtools::install_github("nategarton13/sparseRGPs")``` in R/Rstudio. Once 
installed, the two main functions for fitting and predicting with GPs, 
```optimize_gp()``` and ```predict_gp()```, can be used. 

Scripts containing links to data sets and code to run analyses are provided in 
the ```/exec``` folder, which can be found by navigating to the directory 
where the package was installed. Alternatively, these scripts can be 
copy-pasted from Github.
