Title: Fit Sparse Gaussian Processes
Version: 0.0.2
Author: Nathaniel Garton

Description: Fit sparse and full Gaussian processes with Type-II 
  maximum likelihood assuming 
  Gaussian, binary, or Poisson data. In the case of non-Gaussian data,
  the Laplace approximation is used to approximate the marginal likelihood
  and select covariance parameters and/or knots. Predictions in the 
  non-Gaussian case also use the Gaussian posterior approximation 
  implied by the Laplace approximation. In the Gaussian data case, 
  there is an option to use the variational approximation. 
  Otherwise, FI(T)C models are fit.
  In the case that sparse models are used, 
  knots can be held fixed, 
  simultaneously optimized alongside covariance parameters, or 
  optimized using the OAT knot selection algorithm proposed in 
  Garton et al. (2020).
